Analyze the user's request to determine if it's simple or complex:

1. For SIMPLE tasks:
   - Thoroughly analyze the request by examining relevant code, files, algorithms, and related functions
   - Create a detailed, step-by-step plan to complete the task
   - start implementation

2. For COMPLEX tasks:
   - Thoroughly analyze the request by examining relevant code, files, algorithms, and related functions
   - Create a comprehensive plan and divide it into multiple phases
   - Search for MTask.md file in the project directory
   - If MTask.md file doesn't exist, create it
   - Add all phases and detailed steps to MTask.md file
   - DO NOT start implementation - only create the plan
   - After creating the plan, ask the user if they want to proceed with implementation.

If user confirms:
- For simple tasks: Execute the plan step by step
- For complex tasks: Start with Phase 1
- Complete one phase at a time
- Mark each phase as completed before moving to the next
- Continue until all steps are completed
