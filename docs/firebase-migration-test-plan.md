# Firebase Migration Test Plan

## 1. CRUD Operation Testing

### 1.1 Create Operations
- [ ] Create new chat sessions
- [ ] Create chat sessions with varying message counts (0, 1, 10, 100)
- [ ] Create chat sessions with different types of content (text, code, images)

### 1.2 Read Operations
- [ ] Fetch single chat session by ID
- [ ] List all chat sessions for a user
- [ ] Verify correct metadata is retrieved (name, message count, preview)
- [ ] Test performance with large number of sessions

### 1.3 Update Operations
- [ ] Update chat session content (add messages)
- [ ] Update chat session metadata (rename chat)
- [ ] Test concurrent updates to same session

### 1.4 Delete Operations
- [ ] Delete individual chat sessions
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup of both session and metadata documents
- [ ] Test deletion of sessions with large message history

## 2. Migration Testing

### 2.1 Local Storage to Firebase
- [ ] Test migration with empty local storage
- [ ] Test migration with small number of sessions (1-5)
- [ ] Test migration with large number of sessions (20+)
- [ ] Test migration with large sessions (100+ messages)
- [ ] Test migration interruption and recovery

### 2.2 Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with malformed local storage data
- [ ] Test with missing fields in chat sessions
- [ ] Test with extremely large messages
- [ ] Test with images and file attachments

## 3. Security Testing

### 3.1 Authentication
- [ ] Verify unauthenticated users cannot access data
- [ ] Verify users cannot access other users' data
- [ ] Test token expiration and renewal

### 3.2 Firestore Rules
- [ ] Verify read rules are properly enforced
- [ ] Verify write rules are properly enforced
- [ ] Verify delete rules are properly enforced
- [ ] Test rules with different user roles if applicable

## 4. Performance Testing

### 4.1 Read Performance
- [ ] Measure load time for chat history list
- [ ] Measure load time for individual chats
- [ ] Benchmark against previous Google Drive implementation

### 4.2 Write Performance
- [ ] Measure save time for chat sessions
- [ ] Test rapid consecutive writes
- [ ] Compare with previous Google Drive implementation

## 5. User Experience Testing

### 5.1 UI Verification
- [ ] Verify all Drive-related UI elements are properly removed
- [ ] Check for any lingering Drive terminology in user-facing texts
- [ ] Test error messages during connection issues

### 5.2 Offline Support
- [ ] Test application behavior when offline
- [ ] Verify data synchronization when connection is restored

## 6. Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 6.1 Error Tracking
- [ ] Set up Firebase monitoring for errors
- [ ] Create alerts for critical issues
- [ ] Monitor console errors

### 6.2 Performance Metrics
- [ ] Track chat load times
- [ ] Monitor Firebase quota usage
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring for critical paths
