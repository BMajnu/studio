# Fix Chat History Panel Console Logs

## Problem Summary
The application is generating thousands of browser console logs in a short period after clicking the New Chat button. These logs are related to the chat history panel functionality and are causing performance issues.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Investigation
- [x] Analyze the useChatHistory.ts hook to understand the logging architecture
- [x] Identify excessive logging in useEffect hooks and event listeners
- [x] Examine circular dependencies or recursive calls between components
- [x] Analyze code paths triggered when clicking the "New Chat" button
- [x] Identify core issues causing infinite loops or excessive renders

## Phase 2: Logging Strategy Overhaul
- [x] Create a centralized logging utility with configurable log levels
- [x] Add a runtime toggle for enabling/disabling different log categories
- [x] Implement log filtering based on environment (dev/prod)
- [x] Add safeguards to prevent excessive consecutive identical logs
- [x] Replace direct console.log calls with the new logging utility

## Phase 3: Session Management Optimization
- [x] Create EventDebouncer utility to prevent event cascades
- [x] Implement proper debouncing for session state updates
- [x] Streamline event handling for chat-name-updated and history-updated events
- [x] Optimize session creation and loading logic
- [x] Fix issues with duplicate session handling and creation
- [x] Fix the localStorage and IndexedDB interaction to prevent redundant operations

## Phase 4: React Rendering Optimization
- [x] Identify and fix components with unnecessary re-renders
- [x] Implement proper memoization of expensive calculations
- [x] Optimize useEffect dependencies to prevent cascading updates
- [x] Add and use React.memo for pure components
- [x] Fix any missing dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [x] Create test scenarios for chat history operations
- [x] Verify that logging is properly controlled
- [x] Ensure no regressions in chat history functionality
- [x] Measure performance metrics before and after changes
- [x] Document all changes and improvements

## Phase 6: Chat Title Synchronization Fix
- [x] Fix issue where chat titles don't sync between history panel and main chat view after page reload
- [x] Add reload detection to ensure proper state restoration
- [x] Implement robust metadata synchronization with actual session data
- [x] Add session reload tracking to prevent race conditions
- [x] Add focus event handling to check for updates when browser tab regains focus

## Summary of Changes
1. Created a centralized logging system with different log levels
2. Implemented logger UI settings to control logging at runtime
3. Added event debouncer to prevent cascade of events
4. Fixed duplicate session creation and unnecessary storage operations
5. Optimized React rendering with memo and dependency cleanup
6. Replaced all console.log calls with structured logger calls
7. Added caching for session retrieval to improve performance
8. Fixed event handler memory leaks by proper cleanup
9. Added chat title synchronization for page reloads
10. Improved metadata consistency between storage and UI
