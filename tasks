# Simplified Chat History Management Plan

## Phase 1: Local Storage Foundation
1. Identify and update current localStorage mechanisms ✅

   - Document the schema for chat sessions and metadata in localStorage ✅
   - Ensure consistent key naming conventions across the application ✅

2. Simplify chat session naming ✅

   - Implement consistent default naming based on timestamps only ✅
   - Remove related code in `use-chat-history.ts` and `page.tsx` ✅

3. Enhance local persistence reliability ✅
   - Update save triggers to ensure data is always written to localStorage first ✅
   - Implement retry mechanisms for localStorage write failures ✅
   - Add localStorage space monitoring to prevent quota errors ✅
   - Create localStorage cleanup utilities for old/unused sessions ✅

## Phase 2: Streamlined Storage Flow ✅
1. Refine chat session operations ✅

   - Simplify logic in `handleSendMessage` for saving after message updates
   - Create dedicated sync utility that operates independently of UI actions
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies from storage-related hooks

2. Unify storage interfaces ✅
   - Create consistent interface for data operations (get/save/delete)
   - Ensure identical session object structure in both local and Firebase storage
   - Normalize timestamps and IDs between storage mechanisms
   - Implement proper error handling for cross-storage operations

3. Optimize metadata handling ✅
   - Simplify metadata tracking for faster listing of sessions
   - Store minimal data in metadata objects to reduce storage size
   - Improve caching of metadata to reduce reads/writes
   - Update history panel to efficiently use the new metadata structure

## Phase 3: Firebase Integration Refinement ✅
1. Update Firebase storage approach ✅
   - Modify Firebase sync to happen in background without blocking UI
   - Implement batch operations for initial or large syncs
   - Add debounced save mechanisms to prevent excessive Firebase writes
   - Create conflict resolution strategy for when local and Firebase data differ

2. Authentication and user data management ✅
   - Improve handling of user authentication states for data access
   - Create mechanism to merge anonymous/local data when user signs in
   - Implement proper cleanup of orphaned data when users log out
   - Add migration utility for moving between user accounts

3. Add offline support ✅
   - Implement offline indicator in UI
   - Create queue for pending Firebase operations when offline
   - Add automatic retry for failed Firebase operations when connection restored

   - Test with large chat histories to ensure performance
   - Test across different browsers and devices
   - Verify storage limits and handling of quota errors

2. Performance optimization ⬜️
