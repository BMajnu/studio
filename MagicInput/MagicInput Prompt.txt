> Build failed because of webpack error

Prompt:
Make the icons and buttons a little bigger and closer, I mean reduce the gap between the buttons.

Prompt:
I want to completely remove the header bar, but just keep the app name, the buttons, and profile icon or image. Everything, just remove the header bar and make it full space of the context space of the chat as like ChatGPT or other chat AI.

Prompt:
I can see you just removed the background color. But I want the buttons are not keeping some space in their background. I want they will be completely floating. And the main chat interface and context can be behind them. I hope you understand what I am talking about.

Prompt:
I can see still same everything. So first, remove the collapse button where using the user can fold and unfold the header bar. And so, first, remove the fold and unfold button, the arrow button, and make it everything will be folded. That's mean, remove the completely total header section. But keep the buttons as floating. I hope you understand.

Prompt:
You remove the collapse button, but still I can see the header section is there. So, first please remove the header section completely.

Prompt:
Now add the profile button. I button. Language changing button and theme changing button. Add in the top right corner as a floating button. No background. Keep the background transparent. And it will not make any section. It will be completely react as a floating button.

Prompt:
Now I can see there is a big bottom section. Nothing showing in the bottom section. It's just showing black. So, I remove it. So again, remove the bottom section completely.

Prompt:
Still, the bottom section is not removed. Please analyze the code properly and remove it.

Prompt:
stop


Prompt:
stopIn the top, or in the header of the main area of the main UI of the app, there everything is fit, but in the bottom section of the chat interface, I can see there is a blank, very big area. So, make it everything fit in the top and in the bottom, in both sections.

Prompt:
Okay great it works now. 

Prompt:
add the name beside the button icon


Prompt:
Make a border or different color so user can identify the button section always. 

Prompt:
stop


Prompt:
Add the gallery button top of the search bar and link the gallery button to the gallery function, which now has the functionality in the app. So, search it and link to it.

Prompt:
I want the functionality of when the chat history section is folded. The functionality is when the mouse cursor is hovered over the logo (hover on the logo), then the logo will be converted as the unfold button, as like Chat GPT.

Now it's working as hover, but it's not clickable. So make it clickable and working.

Prompt:
Now it's working as hover, but it's not clickable. So make it clickable and working.

Prompt:
So, I can see now the chat history section, that's mean sidebar, chat history sidebar, are working just for dark mode. It's not working for light mode. So, make sure it has the light mode and dark mode both. And I can see the background color and the sidebar color, main background color of the main app UI, and the sidebar color doesn't match. So, make them match.

Prompt:
Okay, good. Now I can see the main UI section is too fitted to the left and right sides. So, on the left and right sides, keep some radius area so it looks professional.

Prompt:
Okay, good. Now I can see the main UI section is too fitted to the left and right sides. So, on the left and right sides, keep some radius area so it looks professional.

Prompt:
Now it is too much gap. Please reduce the gap more, many more.

Prompt:
Reduce the gap, left and right side, many many more. It's still too much gap between the two sides.

Prompt:
Reduce the gap, left and right side, many many more. It's still too much gap between the two sides.

Prompt:
still it too much gap. Also, make sure it will increase and decrease when the sidebar is folded or unfolded.

Prompt:
Now it has become as fast very fit. That means two fit. Please keep a very minimal gap between the left and right side. Very minimal.

Yes, now it's good, pretty good. Now I want the similar gap in the right side as well.

Prompt:
Yes, now it's good, pretty good. Now I want the similar gap in the right side as well.

Prompt:

Prompt:
I don't think you understand what I mean about highlighted. I mean, when the user opens a chat from the search, it will show some effect, like zoom in, zoom out, something like that, or highlight the part he was looking for. And in the search page, it will find the exact part where is the text being looked for, and it will highlight that part in the pop-up UI. I hope it's now clear.

Prompt:
So I found the problem. So when it's open for a millisecond or a second, it shows the keyword or text what for searching are selected, that means highlighted. And instantly it refreshes the page and the highlighted parts vanish. So make sure when it is searching then it will refresh the full app, or the search or the chat history. And when entering the set, it will not refresh. Or if it refreshes one time, it brings back the mark, which means the highlighted part, as before.

Prompt:
Now I can see, when I search and enter on it, there is no selected area showing, that means highlighted area is showing. But when I search again and open a new page or this page again, then for a second or millisecond, showing the highlighted part and as usual, it vanishes when the new page is opened. I mean, new chat is opened.

It seems there was a slight misunderstanding with the copy function. The system copied the image file name instead of the prompt itself. To address this, we need to add functionality so that when an image is generated, it saves the prompt alongside the image. This way, when the user clicks "copy prompt," it will correctly retrieve and copy the prompt text.

Additionally, I'd like to request another button. This button would be for copying the image directly to the clipboard, eliminating the need for a separate download step. If the user wishes to copy the image, they can simply click this button, and it will be available on their clipboard without needing to download it first.

  - Design Concept: "Spice Trail Type"Visual Elements: Text integrated with illustrations of common Indian spices (e.g., turmeric, cardamom, chili peppers) or their abstract representations, forming a border or an organic cluster around the words.Style: Illustrative, Nature, Hand-Drawn.Color palette: Earthy and vibrant – a mix of deep reds, oranges, yellows, and browns, reflecting the colors of spices.Typography: A rustic, perhaps slightly textured sans-serif or a friendly script font that feels authentic and inviting.Layout: Organic and textured, with the spice elements naturally framing or intertwining with the text, creating a rich sensory experience.

**Important Rules for All Prompts:**
1.  **Start with an Action:** Every prompt must begin with "Make a," "Design a," or "Create a."
2.  **Avoid Product-Specific Terms:** Use general terms like "graphic for printing," "vector illustration," "typographic design." Do NOT use "T-shirt," "mug," etc.
3.  **Use Solid Backgrounds:** All designs must be on a solid black or white background. The color palette should be chosen to work on that background.

**Instructions:**
- For each design idea, create a detailed paragraph-long prompt.
- Incorporate all details from the idea: style, subject, colors, composition, and typography.
- Ensure the final prompt is a rich, descriptive paragraph ready for an AI image generator.

**Example Prompt Output Structure:**

*   **For Graphics-Focused:** "Create a graphic novel illustration of a heroic cartoon coffee bean flexing on a winner's podium, with dynamic action lines and a confident expression, on a solid black background. The text 'Coffee Beats Everything' is integrated in a bold comic book font. Use a color palette of warm browns and tans with vibrant red and yellow action effects. The composition is asymmetrical, with high contrast, sharp focus, professional vector art, trending on ArtStation."
*   **For Typography-Focused:** "Design a vintage typographic artwork for printing, with the text 'Coffee Beats Everything' as the centerpiece, on a solid white background. Use a mix of bold condensed sans-serif, flowing script, and strong slab-serif fonts arranged in a balanced stack, framed with typographic ornaments like lines and stars, and a minimalist engraved coffee bean icon. The color palette is a simple cream and dark brown. The composition is symmetrical, with high detail and a textured effect, award-winning typography, classic craftsmanship."
*   **For Typography with Graphics:** "Make a hand-sketched graphic illustration of a coffee plant branch with leaves and cherries organically wrapping around the text 'Coffee Beats Everything,' on a solid light cream background. The text should be in a casual, handwritten script font. The style is loose and organic with imperfect lines in a monochromatic sepia tone. The composition is asymmetrical and flowing, creating an authentic and artisanal feel. High resolution, detailed sketch, rustic aesthetic, trending on Behance for illustrations."

Prompt:
Okay now I want to marge this two api call into one. But make sure it will not compromise with detail. It will do all the same thing what it does in two API calls. First it generates the design idea and then it generates the prompt. But now it will directly generate the ideas and the ideas will be directly in prompt format. So implement it.

Prompt:
I rejected your both edit because you delete here many more things. I just wanted you to merge them not delete any part. So it will make less detail. You should not delete any part here like examples and instruction or so many parts you deleted. So don't it. Try to merge them again and don't remove any part of the two step. Just merge them to one step.

I backed them to orginal.

Prompt:
okay good but I want now there will not be two steps marge them to one step.

Prompt:
You should give an example for a group of prompt, like graphics, typography, typography and graphics mix. So, you will find the proper example from on this file @generate-design-ideas-flow copy.ts . Convert the example to the prompt and add the prompt example to here. Also, you will get more idea about it on this file. So the prompt will be more accurate, creative and detailed.

Prompt:
Now update the step two based on the updated step one. Please read the example based on the step one example. Update the all the other things based on the step one.

Prompt:
Your update ideas are not spacific. Skip optional things, giving examples. Make everything specific, and skip unnecessary things. So rewrite them.

Now I can see you made a mistake and once again I can see the buttons are not in the center. The three buttons: New Chat, Media Gallery, and History Chat. These three buttons are not in the center of the sidebar. So make them center by left and right side and there was an expand collapse button. It was showing when user hover to the logo icon, app logo, when user hover to app logo then it shows the expand collapse button but it's now not showing. Please fix it and back it again.

This change is substantial – it touches the storage layer and requires careful, multi-point edits.
I’ll break it into two atomic commits:
Phase 1 – Robust session loading
In getSessionDirectly try sessionDB.getSession(sessionId) first.
If it returns JSON → parse, return, and silently rewrite lean copy to localStorage (≤150 KB).
If IDB miss → fall back to the existing LS logic / Firebase.
When LS copy is corrupt but IDB copy is healthy, LS is automatically healed.
Phase 2 – Rebuild history index
Add rebuildIndexFromIndexedDB() that:
iterates all keys in IDB “sessions” store,
reads each session’s metadata (name, updatedAt, preview),
writes a fresh compressed history index to LS,
updates React state and fires history-updated.
Call this function if chat_history_index_ls_<user> is removed as corrupt.
Both phases keep operations local; no Firebase needed for guest users.
I’ll implement Phase 1 first (safe, isolated), run quick compile, then patch Phase 2.
